# dorm App
dorm app is a start up received 100kK TL investemnt with 4M TL valuation and terminated because of insufficient monetary resources. The code of the proect maintained by 2 front end and 1 back end developers.

dorm App is an application to find events in your town and see other university students who are willing to participate that event. You can swipe people you see based on your decisions and match if they swipe you back. You can chat with people you match and find your concert/cinema/etc buddies. Also you can use this app for finding flirts. The application was open only for university students.

# Requirements
In order to run this code you need your own AWS access keys and other cloud credentials with same database design. This code is not here to reproduce the project but the give idea about how this system works. There are 2 other back end projects named. dorm-message and dorm-adminPanel which those projects are connected and designed to work as a whole since it is a conplex project.

# Improvements
Users actions such as swipe can be chached in order to reduce database traffic as I did for user accounts and messages. Messages are chached and are checking both from chache and database but not written to database every time.
